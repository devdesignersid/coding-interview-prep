### Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm

**Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm** is a highly efficient method for solving the **maximum subarray sum** problem, which seeks to find the contiguous subarray within a given array that has the highest sum. This algorithm is well-known for its simplicity and optimal time complexity of \( O(n) \), making it one of the most efficient solutions for problems related to subarray sums.

#### Problem Statement: Maximum Subarray Sum

Given an array of integers (which may contain both positive and negative values), the goal is to find the contiguous subarray with the largest possible sum.

- **Example Input**: `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`
- **Example Output**: `6` (from the subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`)

#### How Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm Works

Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm works by iterating through the array and dynamically keeping track of two values:

1. **Current Subarray Sum** (`currentSum`): The maximum sum of the subarray that ends at the current element.
2. **Global Maximum Sum** (`maxSum`): The highest sum found so far across all subarrays.

The algorithm processes each element in a single pass and makes a simple decision at each step: should it include the current element in the existing subarray or start a new subarray with just this element?

#### Steps in Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm

1. **Initialize Variables**:

   - `currentSum` to the first element in the array.
   - `maxSum` to the first element, as the best sum encountered so far.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:

   - For each element from the second element onward:
     - Update `currentSum` by choosing the larger of:
       - The element itself (starting a new subarray).
       - `currentSum + element` (extending the current subarray).
     - Update `maxSum` to be the maximum of `maxSum` and `currentSum`.

3. **Return the Global Maximum**: Once the loop finishes, `maxSum` contains the maximum subarray sum.

> **Intuition**: By choosing between starting fresh or continuing the current subarray at each step, Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm efficiently tracks the maximum possible sum without the need to calculate all subarrays.

#### Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm Code Example

Hereâ€™s an implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxSubArray(nums) {
  let currentSum = nums[0];
  let maxSum = nums[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Decide to either add the current element to the existing subarray or start a new one
    currentSum = Math.max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);

    // Update the global maximum sum if the current sum is greater
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
}
```

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) since the algorithm only requires a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as only two variables are maintained for the sums.

#### Example Walkthrough

Consider the array `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`.

1. **Initialization**: `currentSum = -2`, `maxSum = -2`
2. **Iteration**:
   - At `1`: `currentSum = max(1, -2 + 1) = 1`; `maxSum = max(-2, 1) = 1`
   - At `-3`: `currentSum = max(-3, 1 - 3) = -2`; `maxSum = max(1, -2) = 1`
   - At `4`: `currentSum = max(4, -2 + 4) = 4`; `maxSum = max(1, 4) = 4`
   - At `-1`: `currentSum = max(-1, 4 - 1) = 3`; `maxSum = max(4, 3) = 4`
   - At `2`: `currentSum = max(2, 3 + 2) = 5`; `maxSum = max(4, 5) = 5`
   - At `1`: `currentSum = max(1, 5 + 1) = 6`; `maxSum = max(5, 6) = 6`
   - At `-5`: `currentSum = max(-5, 6 - 5) = 1`; `maxSum = max(6, 1) = 6`
   - At `4`: `currentSum = max(4, 1 + 4) = 5`; `maxSum = max(6, 5) = 6`

The algorithm returns `6`, which is the maximum subarray sum for this array.

#### Variations of Problems Solvable with Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm

Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm can be adapted for various types of subarray problems, such as:

##### 1. Maximum Sum of Circular Subarray

For a circular array, the maximum subarray might wrap around the end of the array to the beginning. To solve this problem:

- Calculate the maximum subarray sum using Kadaneâ€™s algorithm.
- Calculate the total sum of the array, then find the minimum subarray sum (by applying Kadaneâ€™s algorithm to the negated values).
- The answer is the maximum of:
  - The maximum subarray sum (standard Kadaneâ€™s).
  - The total sum minus the minimum subarray sum (indicating a wrap-around).

##### 2. Maximum Product Subarray

For arrays that seek the maximum product rather than the maximum sum, a modified version of Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is used:

- Track both `currentMax` and `currentMin` values at each step, as multiplying by a negative value can turn the smallest product into the largest.

##### 3. Longest Subarray with a Target Sum (Modified Kadaneâ€™s)

This variant requires finding the longest subarray that meets a specific sum rather than the maximum sum. By keeping track of prefix sums and using a hash map, this variant finds the longest sequence with the desired sum.

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Negative Values in Array**: Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm works even with negative values, but if all values are negative, the result will be the least negative number.
2. **Array Length of One**: Ensure that the algorithm initializes correctly with a single-element array.
3. **Handling Wrap-Arounds in Circular Arrays**: Be mindful of variations involving circular arrays, as they require modifications to the standard approach.

> **ðŸ“Œ Practical Tip**: Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm provides a solid foundation for maximum subarray problems, and understanding its variations allows you to adapt it to a range of problems efficiently.

#### Example Problem: Maximum Product Subarray

```javascript
function maxProduct(nums) {
  let currentMax = nums[0];
  let currentMin = nums[0];
  let maxProduct = nums[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Store currentMax to use in calculating currentMin
    let temp = currentMax;
    currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] * currentMax, nums[i] * currentMin);
    currentMin = Math.min(nums[i], nums[i] * temp, nums[i] * currentMin);

    // Update the maximum product found so far
    maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, currentMax);
  }

  return maxProduct;
}
```

This problem finds the maximum product of a contiguous subarray, demonstrating Kadaneâ€™s logic in cases where both minimum and maximum tracking are needed.

### Summary

Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is a powerful and versatile tool for subarray problems, with extensions that make it adaptable to various situations beyond maximum sums. Whether youâ€™re looking to optimize subarray sums, manage circular arrays, or tackle product-based subarray problems, understanding Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm and its variations will provide efficient and effective solutions.
