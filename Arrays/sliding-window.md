### Sliding Window Pattern

The **Sliding Window Pattern** is a powerful technique used to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings in a linear time complexity \( O(n) \). This pattern avoids the inefficiency of nested loops, which would otherwise take \( O(n^2) \) time, making it highly useful for a range of subarray and substring problems.

#### When to Use the Sliding Window Pattern?

Use the Sliding Window Pattern when:

1. **Contiguous subarrays or substrings** are involved, such as finding maximum/minimum values, sums, or specific properties (e.g., "Find the Maximum Average of a Subarray of Size K").
2. You need to **identify dynamic conditions within a changing window** of data (e.g., "Smallest Subarray with Sum at Least K").
3. Problems involve **tracking and updating information** as the window moves across an array.

> **ðŸ’¡ Interview Tip**: Knowing when to apply the sliding window pattern can demonstrate your ability to optimize time complexity in problems with subarrays or substrings.

#### Types of Sliding Window Patterns

There are two primary types of sliding windows: **Fixed-Size Sliding Window** and **Variable-Size (Dynamic) Sliding Window**.

##### 1. Fixed-Size Sliding Window

This type maintains a constant window size as it slides across the array or string. Itâ€™s most useful when you know the exact length of the subarray or substring.

- **When to Use?**

  - The problem specifies a fixed subarray or substring length.
  - You need to calculate the maximum, minimum, or other metrics for a subarray of a specific size.

- **Common Problems Using Fixed-Size Sliding Window**

  1. **Maximum Average Subarray of Size K**
  2. **First Negative Number in Every Window of Size K**
  3. **Maximum Sum of a Fixed-Size Subarray**

- **Solution Template for Fixed-Size Sliding Window**:

  ```javascript
  // Example: Maximum Average Subarray of Size K
  function maxAverageSubarray(arr, k) {
    let windowSum = 0,
      maxSum = 0;

    // Calculate sum of the first window
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      windowSum += arr[i];
    }
    maxSum = windowSum;

    // Slide the window across the array
    for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
      windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }

    return maxSum / k;
  }
  ```

##### 2. Variable-Size (Dynamic) Sliding Window

In this pattern, the windowâ€™s size changes dynamically, expanding or shrinking based on specific conditions. This approach is useful for finding the smallest or largest subarray that meets a condition.

- **When to Use?**

  - The problem involves finding the smallest or largest subarray meeting a condition.
  - Dynamic conditions dictate the window size, such as cumulative sums, distinct counts, or frequency constraints.

- **Common Problems Using Variable-Size Sliding Window**

  1. **Minimum Size Subarray Sum** (find the smallest subarray with a sum â‰¥ target)
  2. **Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters**
  3. **Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement**

- **Solution Template for Variable-Size Sliding Window**:

  ```javascript
  // Example: Minimum Size Subarray Sum
  function minSubArrayLen(target, arr) {
    let minLength = Infinity,
      windowSum = 0;
    let start = 0;

    for (let end = 0; end < arr.length; end++) {
      windowSum += arr[end];

      // Shrink the window as small as possible while the sum is >= target
      while (windowSum >= target) {
        minLength = Math.min(minLength, end - start + 1);
        windowSum -= arr[start];
        start++;
      }
    }

    return minLength === Infinity ? 0 : minLength;
  }
  ```

#### Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm vs. Sliding Window Pattern

While the Sliding Window Pattern is often applied for problems with fixed or variable window sizes, **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm** is specially designed to find the **maximum sum of a contiguous subarray**. Kadaneâ€™s algorithm runs in \( O(n) \) time and is ideal for problems that require optimizing subarray sums without a fixed window size.

- **Example Problem Using Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm**:  
  **Maximum Sum of a Subarray**: Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) with the largest sum.

  ```javascript
  function maxSubArray(arr) {
    let maxSum = arr[0];
    let currentSum = arr[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
      currentSum = Math.max(arr[i], currentSum + arr[i]);
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }

    return maxSum;
  }
  ```

#### Relevant Common Questions for Sliding Window Variations

**Fixed-Size Sliding Window**:

1. **Maximum Sum of Subarray of Size K** - Find the maximum sum for any subarray of size \( K \).
2. **First Negative Number in Every Window of Size K** - For each window of size \( K \), find the first negative number.
3. **Number of Subarrays of Size K with Average Greater than Threshold** - Count subarrays that have an average greater than a given threshold.

**Variable-Size (Dynamic) Sliding Window**:

1. **Minimum Size Subarray Sum** - Find the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a given value.
2. **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters** - Find the longest substring that contains at most \( K \) unique characters.
3. **Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacing K Zeros** - Find the longest subarray with only 1s if you can replace at most \( K \) zeros.

Each of these problems leverages the sliding window pattern to achieve optimal performance by adjusting or shifting the window, avoiding the need for recalculations at each step.
